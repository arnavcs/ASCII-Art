# ASCII-Art

A project that takes images, and converts it into ASCII art. It does this by first making the image grayscale, and then splitting the image into 3 by 2 chunks which are then represented with braille ASCII characters.

## Running

To run this program, replace `myImage.load("./cat.png")` with the filepath of your desired image, and simply run `main.py`.

## Dependencies

* OpenCV
* Python 3.x.x
